General Guidelines\r\nFor each of the four units, you will complete a Data Analysis and\r\nReplication Exercise (DARE) that will require you to integrate\r\nstatistical programming, methodological understanding and scholarly\r\nwriting skills. In the preceding class, you will be provided with\r\nguidance and a detailed assignment that will entail familiarizing\r\nyourself with a replication dataset for one of the papers we have read.\r\nYou will need to familiarize yourself with this small data set, produce\r\na set of tables and figures that replicate some of the results from the\r\npaper, and write up your results in a memo following scholarly reporting\r\nstandards. Each DARE will have a detailed assignment sheet and you will\r\nreceive exemplar models after your work is graded.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Submission Requirements\r\nAll work (with the exception of the final) is due at 11:59pm on\r\nSundays.\r\nWe encourage (though don’t require) you to form pairs (3 people\r\nmaximum) for the DAREs. Both members of the pair should contribute\r\nequally to the submitted product, both members should list their names\r\non their submitted work, both members of the pair should submit the\r\nassignment on Canvas, and each member of the pair will receive the same\r\nscore on the assignment. Please email us if you have attempted to form a\r\ngroup or pair without success.\r\nPlease submit the following two documents for each DARE:\r\nAn .html, .doc/x, or .pdf file that includes your typed responses,\r\ntables, and/or figures to the problems\r\nThe programming code (.Rmd, .R, .do or similar file) that you used\r\nto generate the tables and figures in the above html/doc/pdf\r\nAn aside: you may have noticed the use of the first person plural\r\n(“we”) throughout the course materials and may especially notice it in\r\nthe DARE answer keys. It is not because I believe in the royal we, and\r\nit is NOT because I think it is good practice to write “we” when you are\r\na sole author. Rather, some years a doctoral student will co-teach the\r\nclass with me, and this syntax allows the course materials to be\r\nscalable and inclusive. Please write in the active voice your DARE\r\nmemos. If you are submitting joint work, use first person\r\nplural (“we”), if you are submitting individual work, use first person\r\nsingular (“I”).\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

The two primary goals of the course are (1) to provide\r\nstudents with the analytic tools and skills to assess the quality of\r\nresearch claims in education, human development, and other substantive\r\nfields; and (2) to provide students with the skills to conduct research\r\nthat supports causal inference. The course will introduce students to\r\nfour core methods of quasi-experimental design:\r\ndifference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental\r\nvariables and matching. The course will culminate in either a research\r\nproposal or completed paper using one of the methods from the course.\r\nPrior coursework minimally through multiple regression and\r\nfamiliarity with a statistical programming language (preferably R) is\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting time and location\r\nMondays, 9:00am - 11:50am Lokey 115\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructor\r\nDavid D.

The two primary goals of the course are (1) to provide\r\nstudents with the analytic tools and skills to assess the quality of\r\nresearch claims in education, human development, and other substantive\r\nfields; and (2) to provide students with the skills to conduct research\r\nthat supports causal inference. The course will introduce students to\r\nfour core methods of quasi-experimental design:\r\ndifference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental\r\nvariables and matching. The course will culminate in either a research\r\nproposal or completed paper using one of the methods from the course.\r\nPrior coursework minimally through multiple regression and\r\nfamiliarity with a statistical programming language (preferably R) is\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting Time and Location\r\nClass meets on Mondays from 9:00am to 11:50am in Lokey 115\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructor\r\nDavid D. Liebowitz\r\nEmail: daviddl@uoregon.edu\r\nOffice: 102S Lokey Education Building\r\nOffice Hours: Thursdays, 9:00am - 10:30am or by appointment. On Zoom\r\nor in person. Sign up on Canvas from 9:00-10:00; drop-in last 30\r\nminutes.\r\nZoom: link |\r\nMeeting ID: 633 606 7468\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Learning Outcomes\r\nBy the end of this term, we expect students will be able to:\r\nDescribe the potential outcome framework and use it to assess the\r\nextent to which various research designs support causal claims about\r\ntheir hypothesis tests;\r\nUnderstand, analyze and critique descriptive and causal quantitative\r\nsocial science research;\r\nImplement, in practical terms, research designs to make credibly\r\ncausal inferences in quantitative social science research, including\r\ndifference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental\r\nvariables and matching strategies;\r\nMake progress in developing an independent research project that\r\ncapitalizes on the research tools of EDLD 650.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextbooks and Reading Materials\r\nRequired Text:\r\nMurnane, R.J. & Willett, J.B.

Other readings are linked directly or\r\ndownloadable from the course website.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Logistics and Expectations\r\n\r\nClass Structure\r\nIn general, each analytic method will be covered over two weeks.\r\nClass in the first week will be divided into two parts. First, we will\r\ndiscuss thoroughly the methods and their applications following a series\r\nof questions for which you are required to prepare answers in advance.\r\nThen, we will preview a Data Analysis and Replication Exercise (DARE)\r\nand guide you through a series of analytic programming steps. Class in\r\nthe second week will also be divided into two parts. The first part of\r\nthis class will be devoted to analyzing an empirical paper and comparing\r\nits results with the analytic replication and extensions you will have\r\nconducted. In the second part of the class, we will provide a conceptual\r\noverview of the new methodological strategy that will be introduced in\r\nthe following unit.\r\nEach week, you will read papers from the scholarly literature as well\r\nas chapters from Murnane and Willett (2011) and prepare responses to a\r\nset of detailed questions that we will post on the Canvas website on the\r\nWednesday prior to each class. During class, we will discuss the\r\nquestions at which point we will “cold” call on students at least\r\npartially at random. We do this to formatively assess class members’\r\ngrasp of the course content, to promote more equitable distribution in\r\nclass participation, and to promote a spirit of accountability for\r\ndeveloping a thorough understanding of complex and technical readings.\r\nClass discussions will focus on, but not necessarily be limited to, your\r\nanswers to these questions. Cold calls will be restricted to only those\r\npre-published questions, but the discussion will extend to student\r\nquestions and extension points.\r\n\r\n\r\nGroups and Partner Work\r\nResearch is an inherently collaborative experience. Building skill in\r\nresearch collaboration during graduate studies can be an important\r\ncomplement to technical and analytic skills. We strongly encourage you\r\nto form study groups to engage in the work of the class. Group members\r\nmay jointly prepare responses to the reading questions (these are not\r\nfor submission). We also encourage you to form pairs (3 people maximum)\r\nfor the data replication exercises. Both members of the pair should\r\ncontribute equally to the submitted product and each member of the pair\r\nwill receive the same score on the assignment. Please email us if you\r\nhave attempted to form a group or pair without success.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistical Software\r\nThis course will complement the understanding of methodologies for\r\ngenerating causal inference in social science research design with\r\napplied exercises in the analysis of data to carry out these techniques.\r\nThe teaching team will be able to support your learning in two commonly\r\nused statistical languages: R and Stata. R and RStudio are available\r\nfree of charge to download. We will not directly support other\r\nprogramming languages, but students are welcome to complete either their\r\nDAREs or research project using other software with which they are\r\nfamiliar as long as they produce correct results.\r\n\r\nR and RStudio\r\nStudents can download the latest version of R here. We strongly\r\nrecommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available here.\r\nBoth softwares are free.\r\n\r\n\r\nResources for R and RStudio\r\nWhile we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to\r\nconduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability\r\nto find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are\r\neither available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion\r\nforums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important\r\nskill you should seek to hone. You will never remember all of the\r\nprogramming commands!\r\nHere are some sites where you can find the answers to many R\r\nquestions and learn new tricks:\r\nYaRrr, the\r\nPirate’s Guide to R by Nathaniel Phillips\r\nR for Data Science by\r\nHadley Wickham\r\nCheat\r\nSheets\r\nQuick-R\r\nStackOverflow\r\nStack Exchange\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools\r\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots and the large language models\r\n(LLMs) on which they rely have dramatically increased the speed and\r\nefficiency of many programmers. Members of the teaching team regularly\r\nuse such tools in their analytic and drafting tasks. That said, they are\r\nnot (as least currently) substitutes for skilled analysts and writers.\r\nBeyond AI chatbots’ known proclivity for “hallucinating” facts and\r\nreproducing social biases, their solutions to programming tasks often\r\nrequire adaptation and revision by a knowledgeable human. Further,\r\nbecause their ability to generate text relies on using billions of\r\nphrase chunks in the public domain to predict the next word, their\r\nlanguage on technical topics can be imprecise when many other writers on\r\nthese topics are also imprecise. Thus, while we encourage you to\r\ninvestigate how AI chatbots can help improve your programming and\r\nstatistical analysis skills, we caution you to skeptically review all\r\ncode and language produced to ensure its alignment to the course\r\nexpectations. To be explicit: you may use AI chatbots for assistance\r\nwith your assignments. If you use one to generate your responses, you\r\nmust indicate so on your assignment. You do not need to do so if you\r\nhave used these tools only to help with coding tasks and/or light\r\nediting of your written responses. You are likely already familiar with\r\nOpenAI’s ChatGPT. As you gain more\r\nexperience as a programmer, you may want to use an AI tool that is\r\ndesigned specifically to help with coding such as GitHub Copilot or AskCodi.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule\r\nThis is a high-level sketch of our weekly schedule. For more details,\r\nsee here.\r\nWeek\r\nClass Date\r\nTopics\r\nRequired Readings\r\nAssignments Due\r\n1\r\nJan. 8\r\nA Common Vocabulary\r\nMM Ch. 1-5, 7 Hoxby\r\n2016\r\nStudent survey (Jan. 10)\r\n2\r\nOnline\r\nDifference-in-differences (I)\r\nMM Ch. 8 Dynarski 2003\r\n-\r\n3\r\nJan. 22\r\nDifference-in-differences (II)\r\nLiebowitz et\r\nal. 2022\r\nDARE #1 (Jan. 21)\r\n4\r\nJan. 29\r\nRegression discontinuity (I)\r\nMM Ch. 9 Angrist & Lavy\r\n1999 Dee\r\n& Penner 2017\r\nResearch project proposal (Jan. 28)\r\n5\r\nFeb. 5\r\nRegression discontinuity (II)\r\nHolden\r\n2016\r\nDARE #2 (Feb. 4)\r\n6\r\nFeb. 12\r\nInstrumental variables (I)\r\nMM Ch. 10 & 11 Dee 2004 Angrist et al. 2016\r\n-\r\n7\r\nFeb. 19\r\nInstrumental variables (II)\r\nKim\r\net al. 2011\r\nDARE #3 (Feb. 18)\r\n8\r\nFeb. 26\r\nMatching (I)\r\nMM Ch. 12 Diaz & Handa\r\n2002\r\n-\r\n9\r\nMar. 4\r\nMatching (II)\r\nMM Ch. 13 & 14 Umansky & Dumont\r\n2021\r\nDARE #4 (Mar. 3)\r\n10\r\nMar. 11\r\nPresentations\r\nNone\r\nResearch project presentation (Mar. 11)\r\nFinals\r\nNA\r\n-\r\n-\r\nFinal research project (Mar. 20)\r\nMM = Methods Matter\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading Components and Criteria\r\nFinal grades will be based on the following elements:\r\nData Analysis and Replication Exercises (DAREs) (4 DAREs, worth\r\n10 points each for a total of 40 points): For each of the four units,\r\nyou will complete a Data Analysis and Replication Exercise (DARE) that\r\nwill require you to integrate statistical programming, methodological\r\nunderstanding and scholarly writing skills. In the preceding class, you\r\nwill be provided with guidance and a detailed assignment that will\r\nentail familiarizing yourself with a replication dataset for one of the\r\npapers we have read. You will need to familiarize yourself with this\r\nsmall data set, produce a set of tables and figures that replicate some\r\nof the results from the paper, and write up your results in a memo\r\nfollowing scholarly reporting standards. Each DARE will have a detailed\r\nassignment sheet, accompanying rubric, and you will receive model\r\nresponses after your work is graded. You will need to upload your work\r\nto Canvas by 11:59pm of the Sunday in the week in which the DARE is\r\ndue.\r\nFinal Research Project (10 points for the presentation, 35 points\r\nfor the written manuscript): The central culminating project of this\r\nclass is to initiate and/or complete an original research project,\r\npresent the project to the class, and produce a written product that\r\nmight take on a variety of forms. Our notion of what constitutes a\r\ncomplete project is intentionally vague to permit a variety of projects\r\nat different stages and is subject to negotiation between student and\r\ninstructor. Some examples of the types of projects you might\r\ncomplete:\r\nReplicate and extend a published study that uses (or should have\r\nused) one of the methods taught in the course;\r\nWrite a proposal describing future research drawing on methods\r\nlearned in this course;\r\nWrite a critical synthesis and review article on a substantive area\r\nof interest drawing on methodological lessons from this course; or\r\nConduct and report in manuscript form the results of an empirical\r\nstudy using methods from this course\r\nWe favor projects that will lead ultimately to a scholarly product\r\nthat can appear on your CV. This includes, but is not limited to\r\nconference presentations, published papers, proposals, qualifying\r\npapers, a dissertation. In order to ensure that you make an early start\r\nand continue to make progress on your project, you must submit an\r\ninitial one page overview of your proposed project to us by\r\nJanuary 28 at 11:59pm. You will make a public\r\npresentation of your project to other class members on March\r\n11. Your final written project is due March 20 at\r\n5:00pm. You will have the opportunity to receive extended\r\nwritten comments on one (1) draft of your written project. You may\r\nsubmit your written project by March 13 at 5:00pm and will receive\r\nextended comments that will help you revise your work for your final\r\npaper. If you choose this option, you will receive brief, general\r\ncomments on your final draft.\r\nCourse Participation (15 points): You will be assessed on your\r\ncontribution to the intellectual community of the class via your weekly\r\nclass participation. Students who share answers that are generally\r\nresponsive to the prepared prompts and engage respectfully in the\r\nclassroom community on a regular basis should expect to earn 13 or 14\r\npoints. Consistently insightful responses, questions and participation\r\nwill be awarded 15 points. We do not anticipate that this level of\r\nperformance will be the norm. Participation that is consistently\r\ninaccurate, indicative of a lack of preparation, or marred by frequent\r\nabsences will result in a score of 12 points or fewer.\r\nFinal grades are based on the following scale: A+ 98-100, A 94-97, A-\r\n90-93; B+ 87-89, B 83-86, B- 80-82; C+ 77-79, C 73-76, C- 70-72. Any\r\nwork scoring less than a C- will be required to be revised and\r\nresubmitted. Students taking the course on a Pass/Not Pass basis must\r\nearn a minimum grade of 80% and complete all assignments for the\r\nclass.\r\n\r\n\r\nStudent Engagement Inventory\r\nGraduate students are expected to perform work of high quality and\r\nquantity, typically with forty hours of student engagement for each\r\nstudent credit hour. For this course, the following table shows the\r\nnumber of hours a typical student would expect to spend in each of the\r\nfollowing activities:\r\nEducational activity\r\nHours\r\nExplanatory comments\r\nClass attendance\r\n26\r\n10 class meetings of 2:40 (includes 10 min. break)\r\nClass reading and prep\r\n30\r\nIncludes out-of-class preparation of responses to detailed questions\r\non reading\r\nData Analytic & Replication Exercises (DAREs)\r\n24\r\nDAREs should take approx. 6 hours each (on avg.)\r\nResearch project\r\n40\r\nIncludes data analysis, preparation of presentation, and drafting of\r\nwritten project\r\nTotal hours\r\n120\r\nThese are approximations. Reading and\r\nespecially analytic time will vary per individual\r\n\r\n\r\nCommon Course Policies\r\n\r\nIndigenous Recognition Statement\r\nThe University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the\r\ntraditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today,\r\ndescendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde\r\nCommunity of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of\r\nOregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their\r\ncommunities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\nUO COVID Regulations and Prevention\r\nThe University of Oregon (UO), in accordance with guidance from the\r\nCenters for Disease Control, Oregon Health Authority, and Lane County\r\nPublic Health requires faculty, staff, students, visitors, and vendors\r\nacross all UO locations to use face coverings when in UO owned, leased,\r\nor controlled buildings. This includes classrooms. Please correctly wear\r\na suitable face covering during class. Students unable to wear face\r\ncoverings can work with the Accessible Education Center to find a\r\nreasonable accommodation. Students refusing to wear a face covering will\r\nbe asked to leave the class. Face coverings are not required for fully\r\nvaccinated instructors, provided there is 6 feet of distance to others\r\nand that all others in the class are masked. For full guidelines, which\r\nare subject to change, see the UO’s face covering regulations. Students\r\nshould obtain wipes available outside of classrooms before they enter\r\nclass and use them to wipe down the table and seat they will use. See https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/regulations\r\nfor more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsence and Attendance Policies\r\nAttendance at all class and discussion groups is expected and\r\nrequired. Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or\r\nemergencies that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left\r\non the instructor’s e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to\r\nclass.\r\nAs the university community adjusts to teaching and learning in the\r\ncontext of the COVID-19 pandemic, course requirements, deadlines, and\r\ngrading percentages are subject to change. I will be mindful of the many\r\nimpacts the unfolding events related to COVID-19 may be having on you.\r\nThere may be situations beyond the control of individual students that\r\nlead to excessive absences such as becoming ill, caring for others,\r\nmanaging home schooling, etc. Students are expected to attend class,\r\nhowever if a student misses more than two consecutive classes they will\r\nbe asked to complete a make-up assignment to be developed by the\r\ninstructor to compensate for the missed class time. Each student who is\r\nexperiencing difficulty attending scheduled class times or class\r\nactivities must contact the instructor to develop a plan for making up\r\nthe class time and satisfactorily meeting the credit hours required.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\r\nIt is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value\r\nequity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for\r\nall students. To do so requires that we:\r\nrespect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.\r\npromote a culture of respect throughout the University\r\ncommunity.\r\nrespect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.\r\nreject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any\r\nkind.\r\npractice personal and academic integrity and expect it from\r\nothers.\r\npromote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is\r\nthe lifeblood of the university.\r\nIn this course, class discussions, projects/activities and\r\nassignments will challenge students to think critically about and be\r\nsensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,\r\nnationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic\r\nbackground, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and\r\nother cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged\r\nto develop or expand their respect and understanding of such\r\ndifferences.\r\nMaintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students\r\nfeel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences,\r\nideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the\r\nresponsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or\r\ndiminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This\r\nmeans that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or\r\notherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that\r\nstudents must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s\r\ncomments\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing Pronouns and Personal Preference\r\nThe College of Education is always working to include and engage\r\neveryone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words\r\nyou want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,\r\npronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be\r\nrespected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be\r\nhurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,\r\ngenderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together\r\nabout the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans\r\ncommunity on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used\r\nwith your professor to help them be aware of how to address you\r\nrespectfully. Please visit this university website for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccessible Education\r\nThe University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning\r\nenvironments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction\r\nor design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to\r\nyour participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based\r\ninformation, in-class activities, and exams. The Accessible Education Center works\r\nwith students to provide an instructor notification letter that outlines\r\naccommodations and adjustments to class design that will enable better\r\naccess. Contact the Accessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at\r\n541-346-1155 or uoaec@uoregon.edu for\r\nassistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nChildren in Class\r\nAs a parent of three young children, I understand the difficulty in\r\nbalancing academic, work, and family commitments. Here are my policies\r\n(with credit to Daniel\r\nAnderson) regarding children in class:\r\nAll breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as\r\nnecessary.\r\nNon-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate\r\narrangements cannot be made. I understand that childcare arrangements\r\nfall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick,\r\nand other issues arise that leave caregivers with few other\r\noptions.\r\nIn cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers\r\nto sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend\r\nto your child’s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats\r\nnear the door for your parenting classmates.\r\nAll students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming\r\nenvironment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to\r\nclass.\r\nI understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the\r\nmost difficult aspects of caring for young children. The struggle of\r\nbalancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring (not to\r\nmention being in the middle of a pandemic!), and I will do my best to\r\naccommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations\r\nfor all students enrolled in the class. Please do not hesitate to\r\ncontact me with any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\nReporting Title IX Experiences\r\nAny student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship\r\nviolence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual\r\nharassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu. To get help\r\nby phone, a student can also call either the UO’s 24-hour hotline at\r\n541-346-7244 [SAFE], or the non-confidential Title IX Coordinator at\r\n541-346-8136. From the SAFE website, students may also connect to\r\nCallisto, a confidential, third-party reporting site that is not a part\r\nof the university.\r\nStudents experiencing any other form of prohibited discrimination or\r\nharassment can find information at https://respect.uoregon.edu/ or\r\nhttps://aaeo.uoregon.edu/ or\r\ncontact the non-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of\r\nStudents Office at 541-346-3216 for help.

Students are\r\nprohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that\r\nconstitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not\r\ngive or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on\r\nassignments or examinations without express permission from the\r\ninstructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all\r\nsources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use\r\nonly the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is\r\nany question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is\r\nthe students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor\r\nbefore committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional\r\ninformation about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is\r\navailable at https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism\r\n\r\n\r\nInclement Weather\r\nIt is generally expected that class will meet unless the University\r\nis officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to\r\ncancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced\r\non Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are\r\nalso communicated in other ways described here.\r\n\r\n\r\nMental Health and Wellness\r\nLife at college can be very complicated. Students often feel\r\noverwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with\r\nrelationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If\r\nyou’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your\r\nown–there’s help and support on campus.\r\nAs your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I\r\nwill express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to\r\nresources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the\r\ndetails of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I\r\ncare and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to\r\ndo—for yourself and those you care about. University Health Services\r\nhelp students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you\r\nneed general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with\r\nanother student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck\r\nNest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of\r\nthe specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at\r\nhealth.uoregon.edu/ducknest.\r\nUniversity Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff\r\nmembers to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide\r\nidentity-based support.
