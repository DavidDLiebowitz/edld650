   \small \textit{Notes:} $^{*}p<0.05, ^{**}p<0.01, ^{***}p<0.001$. Cells report coefficients and state-by-year clustered standard errors in parentheses. Models 1 and 3 are limited to states that ever implemented teacher evaluation reforms. Models 2 and 4 are estimated in balanced panels, restricted to state-year observations 5-years before and 1-year after evaluation reform. All models include fixed effects for year and state, are weighted by state enrollment, and adjust for the proportion of FRPL-eligible students and the proportion of students of different ethnoracial backgrounds.
