<div id="course-overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Overview</h1>
<p>This course explores methods for causal inference in educational
research. The two primary goals of the course are (1) to provide
students with the analytic tools and skills to assess the quality of
research claims in education, human development, and other substantive
fields; and (2) to provide students with the skills to conduct research
that supports causal inference. The course will introduce students to
four core methods of quasi-experimental design:
difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental
variables and matching. The course will culminate in either a research
proposal or completed paper using one of the methods from the course.
<em>Prior coursework minimally through multiple regression and
familiarity with a statistical programming language (preferably R) is
assumed.</em></p>

<h1>Class Logistics and Expectations</h1>
<div id="class-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Class Structure</h2>
<p>In general, each analytic method will be covered over two weeks.
Class in the first week will be divided into two parts. First, we will
discuss thoroughly the methods and their applications following a series
of questions for which you are required to prepare answers in advance.
Then, we will preview a Data Analysis and Replication Exercise (DARE)
and guide you through a series of analytic programming steps. Class in
the second week will also be divided into two parts. The first part of
this class will be devoted to analyzing an empirical paper and comparing
its results with the analytic replication and extensions you will have
conducted. In the second part of the class, we will provide a conceptual
overview of the new methodological strategy that will be introduced in
the following unit.</p>
<p>Each week, you will read papers from the scholarly literature as well
as chapters from Murnane and Willett (2011) and prepare responses to a
set of detailed questions that we will post on the Canvas website on the
Wednesday prior to each class. During class, we will discuss the
questions at which point we will “cold” call on students at least
partially at random. We do this to formatively assess class members’
grasp of the course content, to promote more equitable distribution in
class participation, and to promote a spirit of accountability for
developing a thorough understanding of complex and technical readings.
Class discussions will focus on, but not necessarily be limited to, your
answers to these questions. Cold calls will be restricted to only those
pre-published questions, but the discussion will extend to student
questions and extension points.</p>
</div>
<div id="groups-and-partner-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Groups and Partner Work</h2>
<p>Research is an inherently collaborative experience. Building skill in
research collaboration during graduate studies can be an important
complement to technical and analytic skills. We strongly encourage you
to form study groups to engage in the work of the class. Group members
may jointly prepare responses to the reading questions (these are not
for submission). We also encourage you to form pairs (3 people maximum)
for the data replication exercises. Both members of the pair should
contribute equally to the submitted product and each member of the pair
will receive the same score on the assignment. Please email us if you
have attempted to form a group or pair without success.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-software" class="section level2">
<h2>Statistical Software</h2>
<p>This course will complement the understanding of methodologies for
generating causal inference in social science research design with
applied exercises in the analysis of data to carry out these techniques.
The teaching team will be able to support your learning in two commonly
used statistical languages: R and Stata. R and RStudio are available
free of charge to download. We will not directly support other
programming languages, but students are welcome to complete either their
DAREs or research project using other software with which they are
familiar as long as they produce correct results.</p>
<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>R and RStudio</h3>
<p>Students can download the latest version of R <a
href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/">here</a>. We strongly
recommended that students also download the RStudio GUI, available <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.
Both softwares are free.</p>
</div>
<div id="resources-for-r-and-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Resources for R and RStudio</h3>
<p>While we will teach you how to effectively use R and RStudio to
conduct analyses, one of the key skills required to use R is the ability
to find answers on your own. Many common questions or problems are
either available on blogs or have been asked and answered in discussion
forums already. Finding and deciphering those answers is an important
skill you should seek to hone. <em>You will never remember all of the
programming commands!</em></p>
<p>Here are some sites where you can find the answers to many R
questions and learn new tricks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/"><em>YaRrr, the
Pirate’s Guide to R</em></a> by Nathaniel Phillips</li>

<div id="using-artificial-intelligence-ai-tools" class="section level1">
<h1>Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools</h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots and the large language models
(LLMs) on which they rely have dramatically increased the speed and
efficiency of many programmers. Members of the teaching team regularly
use such tools in their analytic and drafting tasks. That said, they are
not (as least currently) substitutes for skilled analysts and writers.
Beyond AI chatbots’ known proclivity for “hallucinating” facts and
reproducing social biases, their solutions to programming tasks often
require adaptation and revision by a knowledgeable human. Further,
because their ability to generate text relies on using billions of
phrase chunks in the public domain to predict the next word, their
language on technical topics can be imprecise when many other writers on
these topics are also imprecise. Thus, while we encourage you to
investigate how AI chatbots can help improve your programming and
statistical analysis skills, we caution you to skeptically review all
code and language produced to ensure its alignment to the course
expectations. To be explicit: you may use AI chatbots for assistance
with your assignments. If you use one to generate your responses, you
must indicate so on your assignment. You do not need to do so if you
have used these tools only to help with coding tasks and/or light
editing of your written responses. You are likely already familiar with
OpenAI’s <a href="chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a>. As you gain more
experience as a programmer, you may want to use an AI tool that is
designed specifically to help with coding such as <a
href="github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> or <a
href="https://www.askcodi.com/">AskCodi</a>.</p>

<div id="grading-components-and-criteria" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading Components and Criteria</h1>
<p>Final grades will be based on the following elements:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data Analysis and Replication Exercises (DAREs) (4 DAREs, worth
10 points each for a total of 40 points): For each of the four units,
you will complete a Data Analysis and Replication Exercise (DARE) that
will require you to integrate statistical programming, methodological
understanding and scholarly writing skills. In the preceding class, you
will be provided with guidance and a detailed assignment that will
entail familiarizing yourself with a replication dataset for one of the
papers we have read. You will need to familiarize yourself with this
small data set, produce a set of tables and figures that replicate some
of the results from the paper, and write up your results in a memo
following scholarly reporting standards. Each DARE will have a detailed
assignment sheet, accompanying rubric, and you will receive model
responses after your work is graded. You will need to upload your work
to Canvas by 11:59pm of the Sunday in the week in which the DARE is
due.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Research Project (10 points for the presentation, 35 points
for the written manuscript): The central culminating project of this
class is to initiate and/or complete an original research project,
present the project to the class, and produce a written product that
might take on a variety of forms. Our notion of what constitutes a
complete project is intentionally vague to permit a variety of projects
at different stages and is subject to negotiation between student and
instructor. Some examples of the types of projects you might
complete:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Replicate and extend a published study that uses (or should have
used) one of the methods taught in the course;</li>
<li>Write a proposal describing future research drawing on methods
learned in this course;</li>
<li>Write a critical synthesis and review article on a substantive area
of interest drawing on methodological lessons from this course; or</li>
<li>Conduct and report in manuscript form the results of an empirical
study using methods from this course</li>
</ul>
<p>We favor projects that will lead ultimately to a scholarly product
that can appear on your CV. This includes, but is not limited to
conference presentations, published papers, proposals, qualifying
papers, a dissertation. In order to ensure that you make an early start
and continue to make progress on your project, you must submit an
initial one page overview of your proposed project to us by
<strong>January 28 at 11:59pm</strong>. You will make a public
presentation of your project to other class members on <strong>March
11</strong>. Your final written project is due <strong>March 20 at
5:00pm</strong>. You will have the opportunity to receive extended
written comments on one (1) draft of your written project. You may
submit your written project by March 13 at 5:00pm and will receive
extended comments that will help you revise your work for your final
paper. If you choose this option, you will receive brief, general
comments on your final draft.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Course Participation (15 points): You will be assessed on your
contribution to the intellectual community of the class via your weekly
class participation. Students who share answers that are generally
responsive to the prepared prompts and engage respectfully in the
classroom community on a regular basis should expect to earn 13 or 14
points. Consistently insightful responses, questions and participation
will be awarded 15 points. We do not anticipate that this level of
performance will be the norm. Participation that is consistently
inaccurate, indicative of a lack of preparation, or marred by frequent
absences will result in a score of 12 points or fewer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Final grades are based on the following scale: A+ 98-100, A 94-97, A-
90-93; B+ 87-89, B 83-86, B- 80-82; C+ 77-79, C 73-76, C- 70-72. Any
work scoring less than a C- will be required to be revised and
resubmitted. Students taking the course on a Pass/Not Pass basis must
earn a minimum grade of 80% and complete all assignments for the
class.</p>

<div id="indigenous-recognition-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>Indigenous Recognition Statement</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the
traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today,
descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde
Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of
Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their
communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.</p>
</div>
<div id="uo-covid-regulations-and-prevention" class="section level2">
<h2>UO COVID Regulations and Prevention</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon (UO), in accordance with guidance from the
Centers for Disease Control, Oregon Health Authority, and Lane County
Public Health requires faculty, staff, students, visitors, and vendors
across all UO locations to use face coverings when in UO owned, leased,
or controlled buildings. This includes classrooms. Please correctly wear
a suitable face covering during class. Students unable to wear face
coverings can work with the Accessible Education Center to find a
reasonable accommodation. Students refusing to wear a face covering will
be asked to leave the class. Face coverings are not required for fully
vaccinated instructors, provided there is 6 feet of distance to others
and that all others in the class are masked. For full guidelines, which
are subject to change, see the UO’s face covering regulations. Students
should obtain wipes available outside of classrooms before they enter
class and use them to wipe down the table and seat they will use. See <a
href="https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/regulations">https://coronavirus.uoregon.edu/regulations</a>
for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="absence-and-attendance-policies" class="section level2">
<h2>Absence and Attendance Policies</h2>
<p>Attendance at all class and discussion groups is expected and
required. Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or
emergencies that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left
on the instructor’s e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to
class.</p>
<p>As the university community adjusts to teaching and learning in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to change. I will be mindful of the many
impacts the unfolding events related to COVID-19 may be having on you.
There may be situations beyond the control of individual students that
lead to excessive absences such as becoming ill, caring for others,
managing home schooling, etc. Students are expected to attend class,
however if a student misses more than two consecutive classes they will
be asked to complete a make-up assignment to be developed by the
instructor to compensate for the missed class time. Each student who is
experiencing difficulty attending scheduled class times or class
activities must contact the instructor to develop a plan for making up
the class time and satisfactorily meeting the credit hours required.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value
equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for
all students. To do so requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.</li>
<li>promote a culture of respect throughout the University
community.</li>
<li>respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.</li>
<li>reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any
kind.</li>
<li>practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from
others.</li>
<li>promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is
the lifeblood of the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and
assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be
sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity,
nationality, documentation, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic
background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and
other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged
to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such
differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students
feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences,
ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the
responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or
diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This
means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or
otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that
students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s
comments</p>
</div>
<div id="using-pronouns-and-personal-preference" class="section level2">
<h2>Using Pronouns and Personal Preference</h2>
<p>The College of Education is always working to include and engage
everyone. One way we can do this is to share your pronouns, or the words
you want to be called when people aren’t using your name. Like names,
pronouns are an important part of how we identify that deserves to be
respected. And we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be
hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender,
genderqueer, or non-binary. As a community, we are all learning together
about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans
community on campus. Please discuss the pronouns you wish to be used
with your professor to help them be aware of how to address you
respectfully. Please visit this university <a
href="https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns">website</a> for more
information.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessible-education" class="section level2">
<h2>Accessible Education</h2>
<p>The University of Oregon is working to create inclusive learning
environments. Please notify me if there are aspects of the instruction
or design of this course that result in disability-related barriers to
your participation. Participation includes access to lectures, web-based
information, in-class activities, and exams. The <a
href="http://aec.uoregon.edu/">Accessible Education Center</a> works
with students to provide an instructor notification letter that outlines
accommodations and adjustments to class design that will enable better
access. Contact the Accessible Education Center in 360 Oregon Hall at
541-346-1155 or <a href="uoaec@uoregon.edu">uoaec@uoregon.edu</a> for
assistance with access or disability-related questions or concerns.</p>
</div>
<div id="children-in-class" class="section level2">
<h2>Children in Class</h2>
<p>As a parent of three young children, I understand the difficulty in
balancing academic, work, and family commitments. Here are my policies
(with credit to <a href="https://github.com/datalorax">Daniel
Anderson</a>) regarding children in class:</p>
<ul>
<li>All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as
necessary.</li>
<li>Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate
arrangements cannot be made. I understand that childcare arrangements
fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick,
and other issues arise that leave caregivers with few other
options.</li>
<li>In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers
to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend
to your child’s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats
near the door for your parenting classmates.</li>
<li>All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming
environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to
class.</li>
<li>I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the
most difficult aspects of caring for young children. The struggle of
balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring (not to
mention being in the middle of a pandemic!), and I will do my best to
accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations
for all students enrolled in the class. Please do not hesitate to
contact me with any questions or concerns.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://aaeo.uoregon.edu/">https://aaeo.uoregon.edu/</a> or
contact the non-confidential AAEO office at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of
Students Office at 541-346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different
reporting requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or
discrimination, additional information about reporting requirements for
discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship
violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual
harassment is available at <a

<div id="reporting-obligations" class="section level2">
<h2>Reporting Obligations</h2>
<p>I am a student-directed employee. For information about my reporting
obligations as an employee, please see Employee Reporting Obligations on
the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance (OICRC)
website. Students experiencing any form of prohibited discrimination or
harassment, including sex or gender-based violence, may seek information

</div>
<div id="academic-misconduct" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
<p>The University Student Conduct Code (available at
conduct.uoregon.edu) defines academic misconduct. Students are
prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that
constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not
give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on
assignments or examinations without express permission from the
instructor. Students should properly acknowledge and document all
sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use
only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is
any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is
the students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor
before committing or attempting to commit the act. Additional
information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is
available at <a
href="https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism">https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism</a></p>

<div id="inclement-weather" class="section level2">
<h2>Inclement Weather</h2>
<p>It is generally expected that class will meet unless the University
is officially closed for inclement weather. If it becomes necessary to
cancel class while the University remains open, this will be announced
on Canvas and by email. Updates on inclement weather and closure are
also communicated in other ways described <a
href="https://hr.uoregon.edu/about-hr/campus-notifications/inclement-weather/inclement-weather-immediate-updates">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="mental-health-and-wellness" class="section level2">
<h2>Mental Health and Wellness</h2>
<p>Life at college can be very complicated. Students often feel
overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with
relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If
you’re facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your
own–there’s help and support on campus.</p>
<p>As your instructor if I believe you may need additional support, I
will express my concerns, the reasons for them, and refer you to
resources that might be helpful. It is not my intention to know the
details of what might be bothering you, but simply to let you know I
care and that help is available. Getting help is a courageous thing to
do—for yourself and those you care about. University Health Services
help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you
need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with
another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck
Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of
the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. Find out more at
health.uoregon.edu/ducknest.</p>
<p>University Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff
members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide
identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential.
Find out more at counseling.uoregon.edu or by calling 541-346-3227
(anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is
available by calling this same number).</p>

<div id="basic-needs" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Needs</h2>

sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place
to live and believes this may affect their performance in the course is
urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall)

students who are unable to attend a class for religious obligations or
observance reasons, in accordance with the university discrimination
policy which says “Any student who, because of religious beliefs, is
unable to attend classes on a particular day shall be excused from
attendance requirements and from any examination or other assignment on
that day. The student shall make up the examination or other assignment
missed because of the absence.” To request accommodations for this
