# Roadmap

```{r, echo=F}
  include_graphics("causal_id.jpg")
```

---
# Mid-term feedback

### Keep doing
- Detailed feedback on assignments
- Accountability
- Well organized class materials and meaningful content

--

### Concerns and shifts
- Inappropriate level of challenge (though some signs of improvement)
- Insufficient scaffolding for DAREs
- Class questions too basic and lengthy, appear intended as completion check
- Foster better climate around discussion question participation
- Read and review paper before doing DARE

---
# Goals

### 1. Conduct and interpret RD analysis in simplified data

### 2. Assess the basic assumptions of the RD design

### 3. Describe the conceptual and simple mathematical approach for identifying causal effects using the instrumental variables approach

**The effect of a treatment $(D_{i})$ on an outcome of interest $(Y_{i})$:**
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}D_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

--

**Now, let's apply this to a particular context:**
$$INC_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}COLLEGE_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

# A mysterious solution

.blue[**Can we fix this without a sudden change across time and geography that we might term a "natural" experiment?**]

--

- What if we have data on another mysterious variable...?
- Let's call this variable an "instrument" and assign it the letter $Z_{i}$ for each individual $i$
- Let's suppose that it predicts treatment $(D_{i})$ and is itself exogenously determined

# An instrument?

**But what serves as a helpful and valid instrument?**

--

### Valid instruments:
1. Instrument $(Z_{i})$ must be correlated with treatment $(D_{i})$, .red[*but*]
2. Instrument $(Z_{i})$ must be orthogonal $(\perp)$ to all other determinants of the outcome $(Y_{i})$ 
  - Another way of saying it must be uncorrelated with the residuals $(\varepsilon_{i})$
3. Instrument must be related to the outcome .red[*only*] through the treatment
  - This is known as the .blue[**exclusion restriction**] (we'll come back to this)

# Two-stage least squares (2SLS) IV

### 1<sup>st</sup> stage:
Regress the endogenous treatment $(D_{i})$ on instrumental variable $(Z_{i})$ using OLS:
$$D_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}Z_{i} + \nu_{i}$$

Obtain the *predicted values* of the treatment $(\hat{D_{i}})$ from this fit.<sup>[1]</sup>

--

### 2<sup>nd</sup> stage:
Regress the outcome $(Y_{i})$ on the predicted values of the treatment $(\hat{D_{i}})$ using OLS:
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\hat{D_{i}} + \varepsilon_{i}$$


.footnote[[1] This doesn't get the standard errors correct, have to adjust *post-hoc*, but this is automated in all statistical software.]

---
# IV assumptions (re-stated)

Stage 1: $D_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}Z_{i} + \nu_{i}$

Stage 2: $Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\hat{D_{i}} + \varepsilon_{i}$

### Assumptions:
1. .red-pink[Instrument must be correlated with the endogenous predictor (i.e., cannot be a **"weak" instrument**)]
2. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the first stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)$
3. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the second stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\varepsilon} = 0)$

---
# IV assumptions 


### Assumptions:
1. .red-pink[Instrument must be correlated with the endogenous predictor (i.e., cannot be a **"weak" instrument**)]
2. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the first stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)$
3. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the second stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\varepsilon} = 0)$

--

.red-pink[**Problems with #1:**]
- If $Z$ does not predict $D$, it would be a .blue[**"weak instrument"**]
- There would be no (minimal) variation in the obtained predicted values of the question predictor in the second stage
- The estimated regression slope would be *indeterminate* (or close to it)

---
# IV assumptions

### Assumptions:
1. Instrument must be correlated with the endogenous predictor (i.e., cannot be a **"weak" instrument**)
2. .red-pink[Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the first stage equation] $\color{red}{(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)}$
3. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the second stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\varepsilon} = 0)$

--

.red-pink[**Problems with #2:**]
- If $Z$ is correlated with $\nu_{i}$, then $Z$ would be endogenous in the first stage equation
- The values of the question predictor would be replaced by biased predicted values, and the estimated regression coefficient would be biased in ways similar to biased multi-variate regression models

---
# IV assumptions 

### Assumptions:
1. Instrument must be correlated with the endogenous predictor (i.e., cannot be a **"weak" instrument**)
2. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the first stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)$
3. .red-pink[Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the second stage equation] $\color{red}{(\sigma_{Z\varepsilon} = 0)}$

--

.red-pink[**Problems with #3:**]

The statistical basis for IV of a potentially endogenous relationship is that: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_{1} = \left( \frac{\sigma_{YZ}}{\sigma_{DZ}} \right) - \left( \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon Z}}{\sigma_{DZ}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\sigma_{YZ}$ is the population covariance of outcome $Y$ and instrument $Z$, $\sigma_{\varepsilon Z}$ is the population covariation of residual $\varepsilon$ and instrument $Z$, and $\sigma_{DZ}$ is the population covariance of treatment $D$ and instrument $Z$.

2. Instrument must *not* be correlated with the residuals in the first stage equation $(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)$

.red-pink[**Problems with #3:**]

The statistical basis for IV of a potentially endogenous relationship is that: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta_{1} = \left( \frac{\sigma_{YZ}}{\sigma_{DZ}} \right) - \left( \frac{\sigma_{\varepsilon Z}}{\sigma_{DZ}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

.red[**as long as**]: (1) $\sigma_{\varepsilon Z} = 0$; and (2) $\sigma_{DZ} \neq 0$.

--

If $Z$ correlated with $\varepsilon$, then $\sigma_{\varepsilon Z} \neq 0$ and $\beta_{1}$ will be biased.

# Exclusion restriction (visually)

**Those DAG-gone things come back...**

```{r, echo=F}

The .blue[**exclusion restriction**] states that the path by which the instrument influences the outcome goes **exclusively** through the endogenous predictor.

# Very special instruments

| Outcome               |  Intervention (treatment)               |  Omitted variables                        | Instrument

| Reading achievement   |  Class size                             |  Incomplete compliance to Maimonides' Rule| Rule-based assignment
| Reading achievement   |  Randomly assigned reading intervention |  Incomplete compliance; attrition         | Assignment to intervention

# NY vouchers (Ch. 4 *MM*)

**Recall the NY Voucher experiment from Week 1**
- Low-income families *randomized* by lottery to **treatment** and **control** groups
  + Treatment families *received a voucher* to cover partial tuition costs at private schools;
  + Control families *received no voucher*
- Subsequent academic achievement measured for participating children:

--

$$READ_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}VOUCHER_{i} + \textbf{X}_{i}\gamma + \varepsilon_{i}$$

--

- $\beta_{1}$ represents the causal effect of **voucher receipt** on reading achievement
- Because children were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions, predictor $VOUCHER_{i}$ is exogenous and children in the “Voucher” and “No Voucher” conditions are equal in expectation, prior to treatment.
- We can obtain an unbiased estimate of $\beta_{1}$ straightforwardly, using OLS regression analysis.

---
# But wait a minute...

While families were randomly assigned to "Voucher" and "No Voucher" conditions, **actual attendance** at private versus public schools was *not* randomly assigned.

--

.pull-left[
In first year of experiment, **5% of kids** whose families *did not receive vouchers* went to private school anyway
- Families wanted their kids taught in a religious setting
- Families wanted their kids out of public schools
- Families had greater financial and social resources
]

--

.pull-right[
In first year of experiment, **18% of kids** whose families *received vouchers* still went to public school
- Families lived too far from school and couldn't transport
- Families couldn't make up difference of private school fees
- Families didn't feel welcome in private school setting
]

--

As a result of these unobserved choices:
1. **Attendance** at public and private school was *not* assigned exogenously
2. Children who **attended** each kind of school were **not .blue[equal in expectation]** beforehand

---
# Same ole' endogeneity problem

Want to estimate:

$$READ_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}PRIVATE_{i} + \textbf{X}_{i}\gamma + \varepsilon_{i}$$

but, unobserved characteristics (such as school accessibility, family resources, motivation, etc.) may determine whether the child goes to private school and also determine her outcomes. 

--

Because these **unobserved characteristics** are omitted as explicit predictors but affect the outcome, their effects are present in the residual $(\varepsilon_{i})$. 

--

Consequently, $PRIVATE_{i}$ will be correlated with the residuals and an OLS estimate of $\beta_{1}$ will be biased!

---
# An IV solution!

- Offer of voucher *was* .blue[**randomized and exogenous**]
- Offer of voucher likely to be correlated with **attendance** at a private or a public school because many families who got the voucher did in fact use it, and many families who didn’t sent their kids to public school
- Being randomized to voucher receipt is unlikely to predict the child’s ultimate achievement, *except through its impact on private school attendance*
  + No .blue[**third path**]!
  
--

We can use instrumental variable estimation, with attendance at private school $(PRIVATE_{i})$ as the endogenous question predictor and lottery-based receipt of a voucher $(VOUCHER_{i})$ as the instrument!

---
# An IV solution!

We can use instrumental variable estimation, with attendance at private school $(PRIVATE_{i})$ as the endogenous question predictor and lottery-based receipt of a voucher $(VOUCHER_{i})$ as the instrument!

.blue[**How would you write this?**]

--

**1<sup>st</sup> stage:**

$$PRIVATE_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}VOUCHER_{i} + \alpha_{2}READ0_{i} + \delta_{i}$$

--

**2<sup>nd</sup> stage:**

$$READ1_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \hat{PRIVATE}_{i} + \beta_{2}READ0_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

--

Note the inclusion of baseline reading scores $(READ0_{i})$ to improve precision and the inclusion of all covariates from Stage 1 in Stage 2!

--

$\beta_{1}$ is our causal parameter of interest and represents the estimated .blue[**Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)**] of attending private school on lagged-score adjusted reading scores. .blue[*But to whom is it "local"? To whom do these estimates pertain?*]

---
## On which participants does IV depend?

This is an exemplar for any causal analysis that relies on an original randomized offer, but is followed by endogenous “take-up.” It also provides considerable insight into what an IV estimator is actually estimating:

--

.small[
|                       |  Never takers               |  Always takers                        | Compliers
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                        | *(never accept treatment)* | *(always seek out and obtain treatment)* | *(accept treatment if assigned; accept control if assigned)*
| **Voucher=1**          |  "Not treated"              |  "Treated"     | "Treated" 
| **Voucher=0**          |  "Not treated"              |  "Treated"     | "Not treated"
]

An IV estimate is often referred to as the effect of the .blue[**Treatement on the Treated (TOT)**].

--
Covariance algebra tells us that only the .blue[**compliers**] actually contribute to the IV estimate. IV is a LATE estimator, so only those participants whose actions respond to the instrument will participate in the estimate. .blue[**IV is the treatment effect for the compliers.**]

--

This approach assumes that there are no .blue[**defiers**]. These would be people who seek out private schools *only when they don't receive the voucher* (they would otherwise have gone to public) and vice-versa.
