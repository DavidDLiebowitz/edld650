# Correlation and causation 

.large[
-	Causal, correlational and descriptive research are all important, but they are distinct and should be approached differently
-	If you encounter a research study (or embark on your own research project) an important first consideration to ask yourself is: 
  + Is this study attempting to an answer an explicitly or implicitly causal question? If so, what are its identifying assumptions?
-	One framework for considering these identifying assumptions : .blue[**the potential outcomes framework**]
]

---
# Causal inference: Platonic ideal


$Y_{i}^{1}$ = potential value of outcome for $i^{th}$ person, when treated $(D_{i} = 1)$

$Y_{i}^{0}$ = potential value of outcome for $i^{th}$ person, when .blue[**NOT**] treated $(D_{i} = 0)$


The .blue[**Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)**] is the difference in potential outcome values between treatment and control conditions, for each individual:

$$ITE_{i} = Y_{i}^{1} - Y_{i}^{0}$$

--

.red[**We never actually observe this!!!**]

--


The .blue[**Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**] is the average of the individual treatment effects across all participants:

$$\hat{ATE}_{i} = \frac{1}{n}{\sum_{i}^n ITE_{i}}$$

--

If the ATE differed from zero, we could claim that the treatment *caused* the effect because there would be no other explanation for the differences detected between the treatment and control conditions!

---
# Conditions of causal claims

.large[
1. Cause must precede effect in time
2. Systematic variation in levels of cause must result in corresponding variation in the effect
3. Must be able to discount all other plausible explanations

]

---
# RCTs: Gold Standard

Randomly assign each participant to the .blue[**Treatment**] (where we measure their value of $Y_{i}^{1}$ ) or .red[**Control**] (where we measure their value of $Y_{i}^{0}$ ) condition. 


$$\hat{ATE}_{i} = \frac{1}{n_{1}}{\sum_{i}^{n_1} ITE_{i}} - \frac{1}{n_{0}}{\sum_{i}^{n_0} ITE_{i}}$$

--

- .small[Treatment variation is .blue[**exogenously and randomly assigned**].] 
- .small[Members of the treatment and control groups are then equivalent, on average, in the population (.blue[“equal in expectation”]) before the experiment begins, on every possible dimension,] $\bar{\textbf{X}}_{D=1} \approxeq \bar{\textbf{X}}_{D=0}$
- .small[The values of treatment variable, D, will also be completely uncorrelated with all characteristics of participants, observed and unobserved, in the population.]

# RCTs: Issues and assumptions

- **Randomization**: Was it successful Check balance at variable level and with omnibus $F$-test
- **Sample**: Representative? Sufficiently powered? for tests of heterogeneity? Pre-registered?
- **Threats**:

  + Hawthorne/John Henry
  + Non-compliance

# RD: Issues and Assumptions

1. A **.red[Local] Average Treatment Effect (LATE)**
 - bandwidth selection (bias v. variance tradeoff)
2. Functional-form specification
3. Forcing variable predicts treatment discontinuously
4. No manipulation
5. No bunching

# 2SLS IV set-up

### 1<sup>st</sup> stage:
Regress the endogenous treatment $(D_{i})$ on instrumental variable $(Z_{i})$ using OLS:
$$D_{i} = \alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1}Z_{i} + \nu_{i}$$

Obtain the *predicted values* of the treatment $(\hat{D_{i}})$ from this fit.


### 2<sup>nd</sup> stage:
Regress the outcome $(Y_{i})$ on the predicted values of the treatment $(\hat{D_{i}})$:
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\hat{D_{i}} + \varepsilon_{i}$$

---
# Valid instruments

1. Instrument $(Z_{i})$ must be correlated with treatment $(D_{i})$, .red[*but*]
2. Instrument $(Z_{i})$ must be orthogonal $(\perp)$ to all other determinants of the outcome $(Y_{i})$ 
  - Another way of saying it must be uncorrelated with the residuals $(\varepsilon_{i})$
3. Instrument must be related to the outcome .red[*only*] through the treatment
  - This is known as the .blue[**exclusion restriction**]

  scale_discrete_manual(aesthetics = c("color"), values = c(purple, red_pink)) +
  theme(legend.position = "") +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=F)
```
]

**Big idea**: if we were sure we knew that the only factor driving selection into treatment was individuals' membership in this group:
- We can ignore overall point cloud and refuse to estimate the biased Y|X slope
- Instead, conduct analysis within each subsidiary point clouds
  + Obtain estimates of treatment effect within each point cloud
  + Average to obtain overall *unbiased* estimate of treatment effect of more educational attainment

# Matching routines
### Phase I:

1. Investigate the selection process explicitly by fitting a "selection model":
  - Could use exact, coarsened exact, etc. family of approaches
  - Or fit a logistic model, with treatment group membership as outcome, and predictors you believe describe the process of selection explicitly:
$$D_{i} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{X}_{i} \theta_{i}}}$$
2. Use selection model to estimate fitted probability of selection into treatment $(\hat{p})$ for each participant


### Phase II:

1. Enforce overlap in sample
2. Check balancing condition has been satisfied
3. Estimate treatment effect in matched (weighted) sample

# Putting it all together

.blue[**Is there a hierarchy of causal inference strategies?**]

--
.red-pink[.large[**NO!**]]

--
Each research design is the best design and has the highest degree of internal validity, *given the data-generating process*.

--

A regression discontinuity design with poorly met assumptions (*e.g., manipulation or even insufficient observations on one side of discontinuity that prevent modeling appropriate functional form*) is not a "better" design than a well-justified matching study.

--
An RCT with great internal validity might not teach us as much as a generalizable RD.

--

Always conduct research designed to make causal inference with a mix of "humble and hotshot" attitude
