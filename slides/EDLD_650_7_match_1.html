## Core causal inference challenge

### What is basic problem of drawing causal inferences from non-experimental (observational) data or data from a non-random subset within an experiment?

--

1. Treatment and non treatment groups are not .blue[*equal in expectation*], so it is difficult to claim .blue[*variation in treatment condition*] is driving .blue[*observed differences in outcomes*]
2. Sample is .blue[*no longer representative*] of the population (as originally defined)

--

`\(\rightarrow\)` .red[**Biased estimate of treatment effect**]

--

Up until now, we have relied on being able to find an arguably .blue[*exogenous*] source of variation in likelihood of receiving the treatment...

--
.red[**but what if we can't find this???!!?**]

# Selection bias

Imagine: outcome `\(Y\)` is a measure of later life success that depends on an earlier education attainment, `\(X\)`; *AND* that this is the actual, causal relationship between X and Y:

]

.small[
- but...in addition to the true causal relationship between X and Y, society consistently favors one group over another and in-so-doing, constrains some individuals' ability to access higher levels of educational attainment (X)
- so...one group of individuals would consistently experience higher levels of attainment (X) *and* later life success (Y)

- however...we would not necessarily observe this constraint or know what this group is, and so we would only observe a .red[*biased*] relationship between X and Y

# A possible solution?

**Big idea**: if we were sure we knew that the only factor driving selection into treatment was individuals' membership in this group:
- Can ignore overall point cloud and refuse to estimate the biased Y|X slope
- Instead, conduct analysis within each subsidiary point clouds
  + Obtain estimates of treatment effect within each point cloud
  + Average to obtain overall *unbiased* estimate of treatment effect of more educational attainment

# Selection on observables

.large[This is the key conceptual basis for approaches such as: **stratification, weighting and matching**. They are used to remove "observed bias" from treatment effects estimated in observational data.]

.pull-left[ .small[
- This family of approaches relies on .blue[**selection on observables**] into treatment (*more on this later*)
- It is not a magical way of getting causal estimates when you don't have an identification strategy
- Like all the other methods we have studied, it requires a deep substantive understanding of why some are treated and others aren't

# Matching approach

The .blue[**conditional independence assumption (CIA)**] ([Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin, 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335942?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)) states that treatment is as-good-as random conditional on a known set of covariates. 

If .blue["selection on observables"] in fact happens, matching estimators take this literally. 

The basic idea: estimate a treatment effect only using observations with (nearly?) identical values of `\(\textbf{X}_{i}\)`. The CIA allows us to make a claim about causality within these groups.

We match untreated observations to treated observations using `\(\textbf{X}_{i}\)` and calculate the average treatment effect by comparing `\(Y_{i}(1)\)`  to outcomes for "matched" untreated individuals `\(Y_{i}(0)\)`.


---
# The classic tradeoff

&lt;img src="tradeoff.jpg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We want to minimize bias in our estimates by finding a match that most closely approximates each treated unit but we don’t want to overly restrict the definition of matching so as to require excluding too many units or producing a sample that does not reflect our originally defined population.

---
# Propensity scores (I)
### Phase I:

1. Investigate the selection process explicitly by fitting a "selection model":
  - Fit a logistic model, with treatment group membership as outcome, and predictors you believe describe the process of selection explicitly:
  
`$$D_{i} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{X}_{i} \theta_{i}}}$$`
--
2. Use selection model to estimate fitted probability of selection into treatment `\((\hat{p})\)` for each participant
  - Output these “propensity scores” into your dataset
  - They summarize the probability that each participant will be selected into the treatment, given their values on the covariates.
  - They are the best non-linear composite of the covariates for describing selection into experimental conditions, given your choice of covariates.

---
# Propensity scores (II)
### Phase II:

.small[
1. Stratify the sample using the propensity scores:
    - Enforce overlap:
        + Drop control units with `\(\hat{p}\)` below the minimum propensity score in the treatment group
        + Drop treated units with `\(\hat{p}\)` above the maximum propensity score in the control group
    - Common rule of thumb: as few as five strata may remove up to 90% of the observed bias
2. Within each stratum, check the balancing condition has been satisfied:
   - On the propensity scores themselves
   - On each of the covariates separately
3. If the balancing condition has not been met:
   - Re-stratify, combining or splitting strata, until balancing condition is met
   - If this fails, re-specify the selection model (nonlinear terms, interactions?) and start again
4. Once you have achieved balance, estimate treatment effect within each stratum, and average up

# Difference from OLS?

1. It's not that different
2. Regression approaches make strong assumptions about the equivalence of treatment effects across different groups (can be solved with interactions or non-parametric approaches)...
3. including groups **for which there is no common support** (a case of predicting outside of data range and cannot be solved for with interactions)
4. Each additional covariate makes additional assumptions about equivalence of effects across groups (results in X-factorial potential interactions)
5. We’ve assumed that errors are homoscedastic across groups and pooled all of that variation to obtain a common standard error
]

# Good/bad candidates?

.large[**Remember, the only reason any of this is worth doing is if there is a clear case where (a) selection on the observables has occurred; and (b) the source of the selection can not be modeled via exogenous variation in treatment**]

.blue[ With a partner:
- Identify 2-3 examples of situations in which selection into treatment or the sample can be addressed via an approach from the matching family
- Identify 2-3 examples in which a matching approach would be suspect to persistent bias in estimates

# A family affair

### Matching approaches include:
- Stratification
- Propensity-Score Matching (PSM)
   + Nearest neighbor (Euclidian or Mahalanobis distance)
   + Kernel matching
   + Machine learning assisted matching
   + Calipers
   + With or without replacement
- Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
- Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM)
- Inexact Matching
- Synthetic controls in DD strategies
- Doubly-robust (e.g., matching and weighted) estimates
- And combinations of these and more…

...**the approach matters and requires close attention to procedure**

| Approach             |  Strengths                     |  Limitations
|------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Propensity-score nearest &lt;br&gt; neighbor matching w/ calipers and replacement | - Simulates ideal randomized experiment &lt;br&gt; - Limits dimensionality problem &lt;br&gt; - Calipers restrict poor matches &lt;br&gt; - Replacement takes maximal advantage of available data | - May generate poor matches &lt;br&gt; - Model dependent &lt;br&gt; Lacks transparency; PS in aribtrary units &lt;br&gt; - Potential for bias [(King &amp; Nielsen, 2019)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/why-propensity-scores-should-not-be-used-for-matching/94DDE7ED8E2A796B693096EB714BE68B)
| Propensity-score stratification | - Simulates block-randomized experiment &lt;br&gt; - Limits dimensionality problem | - May produce worse matches than NN &lt;br&gt; - Lacks transparency; stratum arbitrary
| Inverse probability &lt;br&gt; (PS) matching | - Retains all original sample data &lt;br&gt; - Corrects bias of estimate with greater precision than matching/stratification | - Non-transparent/a-theoretical
| Coarsened Exact Matching | - Matching variables can be pre-specified (and pre-registered) &lt;br&gt; - Matching substantively driven &lt;br&gt; - Transparent matching process &lt;br&gt; - Eliminates same bias as propensity score if SOO occurs | - May generate poor matches depending on how coarsened variables are &lt;br&gt; - May lead to discarding large portions of sample
