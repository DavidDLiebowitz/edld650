# Roadmap

&lt;img src="causal_id.jpg" width="1707" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Goals

1. Describe threats to validity in difference-in-differences (DD) identification strategy and multiple approaches to address these threats.

2. Using a cleaned dataset, estimate multiple DD specifications in R and interpret these results


---
# Cold-calling

.pull-left[
#### .purple[Purpose]
- Formative assessment
- Equitable distribution of class participation
- Shared accountability for deep understanding of complex and technical readings

#### .purple[Norms]
- Questions posted by Thursday PM
- Preparation is expected
- These are hard concepts; mistakes are expected
- Judgments on accuracy of responses are about the responses, not the individual
- Questions and response are about learning, not performance
]

.pull-right[
#### .purple[Structure]
- All cold calls will be telegraphed
- Questions will come directly from question list
- Random draw (w/ replacement) from class list
- Ample wait time; multiple "at-bats"
- Teaching staff will identify incomplete or incorrect response and seek clarification
- Extension questions on a volunteer basis

# Programming in EDLD 650

## What you won't get ðŸ˜¦
- A heavy dose of data management and visualization strategies
- The most efficient code (My coding skills are ðŸ’©)

--

## What you will get ðŸ˜„
- A review of the programming steps you should take as part of the **actual** research process
- *Some* model code for management and visualization
- Programming strategies and packages that can be used to estimate the causal inference techniques we will study
- A community of knowledge programmers who will expand our knowledge base!

# Estimating a classic, two-period difference-in-differences (DD) model

# Replicating Dynarski (2003)

Recall Dynarski's primary model (Eq. 2):

$$
`\begin{align}
  y_i=\alpha + \beta(\text{FATHERDEC}_i \times \text{BEFORE}_i) + \delta \text{FATHERDEC}_i + \theta \text{BEFORE}_i + \upsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$

**Let's try to fit this!**

# Estimate classic two-period DD
Dynarski's original model:
$$
`\begin{align}

Murnane and Willet have renamed the variable to make clear that a value of 1 means individuals are eligible for aid, so:
$$
`\begin{align}
  y_i=\alpha + \beta(\text{FATHERDEC}_i \times \text{OFFER}_i) + \delta \text{FATHERDEC}_i + \theta \text{OFFER}_i + \upsilon_i

\end{align}`
$$


```r
lm(coll ~ fatherdec*offer + fatherdec + offer, data=dynarski)
```

```
#&gt;

#&gt; lm(formula = coll ~ fatherdec * offer + fatherdec + offer, data = dynarski)

# Central DD asssumptions

In order to fully trust that the estimates produced by a DD analysis are unbiased by endogeneity, we need to make (and defend) the following two assumptions:

1. Not-treated (or not-yet-treated) units are .blue[**valid counterfactuals**]
  - Parallel trends?
  - Selection into treatment?

--
2. There are no .blue[**simultaneous shocks**] or unobserved .blue[**secular trends**]
  - Other observed and unobserved events or patterns?

--

We'll look at how to address some of these in the next section of the lecture, and you'll read more about how to do so in the readings and DARE for next week!

# End of desegregation
- In 1991, 480 school districts were under court desegregation order
- In following two decades, nearly half (215) were released and returned to neighborhood assignment patterns
- Timing of release was arguably .blue[**exogenous**] and .blue[**quasi-random**]. 
- This provides strong support to the claim that the districts which were not (or *not yet*) released from court orders were on .blue[**parallel trends**] in their outcomes with districts that were released and, thus, serve as .blue[**valid counterfactuals**].&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Take a minute to write down what this model does in words. Use the terms .blue[**mean effect**], .blue[**time series**], .blue[**fixed effects**] and .blue[**causal parameter of interest**]. Share with your neighbor.

--

&gt; The model takes advantage of **time series** data in which the black dropout rate in each district is observed at three points in time. The model regresses the black dropout rate in a **fixed effect** model in which observations are clustered in two dimensions: within district `\((\Gamma_j)\)` and also within time `\((\Pi_t)\)`. Note: `\(\Gamma_j\)` represents a vector of dummy indicators that take the value of one if observation *j* is equal to district *j* and zero otherwise. `\(\Pi_t\)` represents a vector of dummy indicators that take the value of one if observation *j* is in time *t* (1990, 2000 or 2010). `\(\beta_{1}\)` estimates the **mean effect** of being observed after being declared unitary and is the **causal parameter of interest** reflecting the effect of being released from a desegregation order `\(UNITARY_{jt}\)` on the black dropout rate.

--

.small[In this case, the estimates rely on .blue[**repeated cross-sectional**] panel data. We could also implement the same framework in .blue[**longitudinal**] panel data.]

### Addressing serial correlation

**The worry**: within-unit correlation of outcomes (e.g., within-state, across state-years) results in correlated (and therefore too small) standard errors. As a result out .blue[**statistical inference**] will be incorrect.

--

**The solution**: .blue[**cluster-robust standard errors**]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Clustering standard errors by the *k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;* regressor inflates iid OLS standard errors by:

`$$\tau_{k} \simeq 1 + \rho_{x_{k}} \rho_{\mu} (\bar{N}_{g} - 1)$$`

where `\(\rho_{x_{k}}\)` is the within-cluster correlation of regressor `\(x_{igk}\)`,  `\(\rho_{\mu}\)` is the within-cluster error correlation and `\(\bar{N}_{g}\)` is the average cluster size.

--

`\(\tau_{k}\)` is **asymptotically** correct as number of clusters increase. Current consensus: this estimate of `\(\tau_{k}\)` is accurate with .blue[**~50 clusters**]. Fewer than 40, and this approach can dramatically under-estimate SEs (consider bootstrapping). 

**Best practice**: cluster at the unit of treatment (or consider two-way clustering).&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

# A flexible approach

What if, instead of assigning a particular functional form to our treatment effects over time (either mean, linear or higher-order polynomial), we specified an entirely flexible model?

$$
`\begin{aligned}
 \text{DROPOUT_BLACK} _{jt} = &amp; \beta_1 \text{pre}^{-n}_{jt} + \beta_2 \text{pre8} + \beta_3 \text{pre7} _{jt} +... \\
&amp; +\beta_m \text{post0} _{jt} + ...+ \beta_n \text{post}^{n}_{jt} + \Gamma_j  + \Pi_t + \epsilon _{j}
\end{aligned}`
$$
--
Could also write as:
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{DROPOUT_BLACK} _{jt} = \sum_{t=-10}^n 1(\text{t}=\text{t}_{j}^*)\beta_t+ \Gamma_j  + \Pi_t + \epsilon _{j}
\end{align}`
$$
--
Think for a moment what this model does?

--

&gt;The model adjusts its estimates of the mean rate of Black dropout in district *j* by the mean rate of Black dropout in year *t* across all districts. Then, it estimates what effect does being *t* years pre- or post-unitary have. The comparison in each of these `\(\beta\)` s is to being never or not yet *UNITARY*.

# Event study visualized

&lt;img src="EDLD_650_2_DD_1_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


--

&gt;The end of desegregation efforts had a causal effect on the Black dropout rate, resulting in a discontinuous and persistent increase of between 1 and 2 percentage points (*caveats, caveats*).

# C-ITS considered

### Strengths
- Takes advantage of full range of data
- Compared to mean-effect-only DD, allows differentiation of discontinuous jump vs. post-trend
- Permits modeling of fully flexible functional form (can include quadratic, cubic, quartic relationships, interactions and more!)
- Data-responsive approach

--

### Weaknesses
- Encourages over-fitting
- Functional-form dependent
- Risks generating unstable models

--

**Note that a fully-saturated C-ITS model (i.e., a model that estimates a coefficient on an indicator for each time period) is identical to an event study.**

class: middle, inverse
#Wrap-up
---
# Goals

1. Describe threats to validity in difference-in-differences (DD) identification strategy and multiple approaches to address these threats.

2. Using a cleaned dataset, estimate multiple DD specifications in R and interpret these results
