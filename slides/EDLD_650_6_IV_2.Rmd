## What's wrong with na&iuml;ve approach?

--

> Only about 90 percent of lottery winners used the private school voucher to pay for private school and 24 percent of lotter losers found other sources of scholarships for which to pay for private school. There are endogenous differences in the expected outcomes of children from families who chose to both use the voucher and those who secured scholarship funding from sources outside the voucher lottery. The policy relevant question is how a public subsidy of private school might affect educational attainment for children from low-income families in Bogota, Colombia. The na&iuml;ve approach does not identify these effects but rather the combination of voucher subsidy and endogenous unobservables across families and individuals.

Obtain the *predicted values* of the treatment $(\hat{D_{i}})$ from this fit.

## Implementing IV in regression

### Reminder of key assumptions:
1. Instrument correlated with endogenous predictor (.red-pink[no **"weak" instruments**])
2. Instrument not correlated with 1<sup>st</sup> stage residuals $(\sigma_{Z\nu} = 0)$
3. Instrument not correlated with 2<sup>nd</sup> stage residuals $(\sigma_{Z\varepsilon} = 0)$ and correlated with outcome only via predictor<sup>[1]</sup>
  + .red-pink[Exclusion restriction means **NO THIRD PATH!**]

--

### Practical considerations:
Can implement this various ways. Pedagogically, we'll implement 2SLS using the `fixest` package because it allows straightforward presentation of 1</sup>st</sup> stage results. This can also be done via `ivreg` and `iv_robust` in R.

.footnote[[1] Don't forget, .red-pink[**no defiers**] too.]

# Instrument with covariates
# Note that these are automatically included in 1st stage
# Can include multiple instruments and multiple

You will see some common rules of thumb about what makes for a strong instrument (e.g., $t_{F}>10$), but recent work has found that with $t$-ratios lower than 100 one should adjust critical value ([Lee et al., 2021](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29124)).

# Interpretation of results

.small[The na&iuml;ve OLS estimates .large[.red-pink[understate]] the effects of a public voucher subsidy for private school attendance for over 125,000 children from low-income families in Bogota, Colombia. Our preferred estimates of the effect of voucher use on eighth-grade completion imply an increase in the on-time completion rate of 16 percentage points.]

--

.small[The estimates of the endogenous relationship between the use of financial aid to attend private school and school attainment (Model 1) imply that students who use any form of external scholarship are 12 percentage points more likely to complete eighth grade. In Model 2, we present results of winning an unbiased lottery to receive vouchers covering slightly more than half the cost of average private school attendance. We find that the offer of the voucher increased eighth-grade completion rates by just less than 11 percentage points. Finally, Models 3-5 present a taxonomy of Treatment-on-the-Treated estimates in which we use the randomized lottery as an instrument for the use of financial aid to attend private school. We find consistent effects 50 percent larger than the Intent-to-Treat estimates. These models are robust to the inclusion of baseline student characteristics, cohort fixed effects, and the clustering of standard errors at the level of randomization (within school).]
