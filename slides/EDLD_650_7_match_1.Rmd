# Core causal inference challenge

### What is basic problem of drawing causal inferences from non-experimental (observational) data or data from a non-random subset within an experiment?

--

1. Treatment and non treatment groups are not .blue[*equal in expectation*], so it is difficult to claim .blue[*variation in treatment condition*] is driving .blue[*observed differences in outcomes*]
2. Sample is .blue[*no longer representative*] of the population (as originally defined)

--

$\rightarrow$ .red[**Biased estimate of treatment effect**]

--

Up until now, we have relied on being able to find an arguably .blue[*exogenous*] source of variation in likelihood of receiving the treatment...

# A possible solution?

**Big idea**: if we were sure we knew that the only factor driving selection into treatment was individuals' membership in this group:
- We can ignore overall point cloud and refuse to estimate the biased Y|X slope
- Instead, conduct analysis within each subsidiary point clouds
  + Obtain estimates of treatment effect within each point cloud
  + Average to obtain overall *unbiased* estimate of treatment effect of more educational attainment

# Selection on observables

- This family of approaches relies on .blue[**selection on observables**] into treatment (*more on this later*)

# Matching approach

The .blue[**conditional independence assumption (CIA)**] ([Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2335942?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)) states that treatment is as-good-as random conditional on a known set of covariates. 

If .blue["selection on observables"] in fact happens, matching estimators take this literally. 

The basic idea: estimate a treatment effect only using observations with (nearly?) identical values of $\textbf{X}_{i}$. The CIA allows us to make a claim about causality within these groups.

We match untreated observations to treated observations using $\textbf{X}_{i}$ and calculate the average treatment effect by comparing $Y_{i}(1)$  to outcomes for "matched" untreated individuals $Y_{i}(0)$.


---
# The classic tradeoff

```{r, echo=F}
include_graphics("tradeoff.jpg")
```

We want to minimize bias in our estimates by finding a match that most closely approximates each treated unit but we don’t want to overly restrict the definition of matching so as to require excluding too many units or producing a sample that does not reflect our originally defined population.

---
# Propensity scores (I)
### Phase I:

1. Investigate the selection process explicitly by fitting a "selection model":
  - Fit a logistic model, with treatment group membership as outcome, and predictors you believe describe the process of selection explicitly:
  
$$D_{i} = \frac{1}{1+e^{-\textbf{X}_{i} \theta_{i}}}$$
--
2. Use selection model to estimate fitted probability of selection into treatment $(\hat{p})$ for each participant
  - Output these “propensity scores” into your dataset
  - They summarize the probability that each participant will be selected into the treatment, given their values on the covariates.
  - They are the best non-linear composite of the covariates for describing selection into experimental conditions, given your choice of covariates.

---
# Propensity scores (II)
### Phase II:

1. Stratify the sample using the propensity scores:
    - Enforce overlap:
        + Drop control units with $\hat{p}$ below the minimum propensity score in the treatment group
        + Drop treated units with $\hat{p}$ above the maximum propensity score in the control group
    - Rule of thumb: as few as five strata may remove up to 90% of the observed bias
2. Within each stratum, check the balancing condition has been satisfied:
   - On the propensity scores themselves
   - On each of the covariates separately
3. If the balancing condition has not been met:
   - Re-stratify, combining or splitting strata, until balancing condition is met
   - If this fails, re-specify the selection model (nonlinear terms, interactions?) and start again
4. Once you have achieved balance, estimate treatment effect within each stratum, and average up

1. It's not that different
2. Regression approaches make strong assumptions about the equivalence of treatment effects across different groups (can be solved with interactions or non-parametric approaches)...
3. including groups **for which there is no common support** (a case of predicting outside of data range and cannot be solved for with interactions)
4. Each additional covariate makes additional assumptions about equivalence of effects across groups (results in X-factorial potential interactions)
5. We’ve assumed that errors are homoscedastic across groups and pooled all of that variation to obtain a common standard error

# Good/bad candidates?

.large[**Remember, the only reason any of this is worth doing is if there is a clear case where (a) selection on the observables has occurred; and (b) the source of the selection can not be modeled via exogenous variation in treatment**]

- Identify 2-3 examples of situations in which selection into treatment or the sample can be addressed via an approach from the matching family
- Identify 2-3 examples in which a matching approach would be suspect to persistent bias in estimates

| Propensity-score stratification | - Simulates block-randomized experiment <br> - Limits dimensionality problem | - May produce worse matches than nearest neighbor <br> - Lacks transparency; stratum arbitrary
| Inverse probablity <br> (PS) matching | - Retains all original sample data <br> - Corrects bias of estimate with greater precision than matching/stratification | - Non-transparent/a-theoretical
| Coarsened Exact Matching | - Matching variables can be pre-specified (and pre-registered) <br> - Matching substantively driven <br> Transparent matching process <br> - Eliminates same bias as propensity score if SOO occurs | - May generate poor matches depending on how coarsened variables are <br> - May lead to disgarding large portions of sample
