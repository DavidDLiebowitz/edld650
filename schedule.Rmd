*	This calendar and reading assignments may change at the discretion of the teaching team. 
*	Readings for a given week are to be completed by the time of the class on that date
*	You can read in any order you like but we have ordered readings for each week in what we think may make the most sense. 
*	For most weeks, we have included supplemental readings. They serve to provide additional perspectives on the methodological or substantive topics of that week. They are not required, but could be insightful to your future academic or professional work.
